# SMN1/SMN2 haplotype data

The `igv_sessions` folder contains IGV session files (xml) that show the phased SMN1/SMN2 haplotypes in 107 Coriell samples.

For details of our method, please check out our [paper](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(23)00001-0) and visit our tool [Paraphase](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/paraphase). Some instructions on interpreting the IGV sessions can be found [here](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/paraphase/blob/main/docs/visualization.md).
